#### Switch

The switch provides an exclusive path for the electrical signal, which transfer through the switch for any two nodes in network. The most common is the Ethernet switch.  

The switch works in the second layer (Data Link Layer) of the OSI reference model. The CPU of a switch forms a MAC table through the MAC address and the corresponding port, when each port on the switch is successfully connected. Inside these communications, it sends the packet for the MAC address only by its corresponding port, instead of all ports.  

The switch manages the data transmission between the multiple ports at simultaneous time. Each port can be registered as a separate physical network segment. The network devices, which connects to the switch, use the bandwidth alone, without the other devices to share.
