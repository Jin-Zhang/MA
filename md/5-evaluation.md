# Chapter 5. Evaluation

## Result analysis and deficiencies    （与其它研究的比较，最好能找到）
The following features of LoYiW project will be evaluated in this chapter, By running on the network devices, get the following results

The following figure shows the result on the mobile device.  The frist line of the result is MAC - Device - Dict, it display only one，when the program is first running. The target IP on the result means IP address of AP, which is connected to the mobile device. The final line of the result is the MAC address of the AP. The result shows that，the AP has been found, which is connected to the mobile device.

The next figure shows that 


Unable to automatically build network
Due to differences between the network device，causing the device can not be found, when the programm was running on the devices

Delay

Positioning accuracy



### 有啥不足，也有啥贴金的地方
1. 无法自动构建网络
2. 延迟严重
3. 定位不精确
4. 命令没有加密
5. 子网的子网

我们最大的问题是，设备比较少，而且比较不专业、不统一。如果是进入实用环节，应该有统一的设备采购，采纳符合技术要求的设备。
