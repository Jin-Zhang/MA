With the development of Wi-Fi technology, it widely used in various industries. Similarly, in location-based services market, the
demand for location-based services grows rapaidly. When people knows the location, it always brings surprises. For example, in large shopping centers, location-based service collects the customer spending habits, sends the discount information with the nearest Stores and shopping cart positioning. In the health care industry, tracking emphasis on patient care, monitoring and control for expensive medical equipment and in indoor environments with a lot of people, such as airport, library and concert hall, on Emergency situation supports escape navigation and real-time location of inquiries.  
As the traditional GPS satellite positioning, it can provide precisely positioning only where relatively open, none high-rise buildings, can’t be used indoors and it has higher power consumption．Therefore, in intensive indoor positioning goals, positioning system
based on WiFi technology become the best choice.

To archiev this goal, a python project named **"LoYiW"** has been implemented. It contains a graphical user interface for management, a simple HTTP server and a bash scripts for server administration.
