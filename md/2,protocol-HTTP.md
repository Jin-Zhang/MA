#### HTTP
**HTTP** is _HyperText Transfer Protocol_ï¼Œwhich is the most widely used network protocol on the Internet. All WWW documents must comply with this standard. Original HTTP was designed to provide a method to publish and receive HTML pages. World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force cooperatively researched and released a series of RFC, including the famous RFC 2616 for the definition of the HTTP 1.1.   

HTTP uses a request - response model in the client-server computing model. After a client establishes a connection to a server, it sends a request to the server, the format of the request method is Uniform resource identifier(URI) and protocol version. The server receives the request, then give the response information. Its format is a status line, including protocol version and a code of success or error. The returned information from server is received by client, it is displayed on the user's screen through the browser. Afterwards aborts the connection.
