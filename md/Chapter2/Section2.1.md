#### The discussion for the indoor location technology based on wireless  

With the rapidly increasing in data services and multimedia services, the increasing demand for positioning and navigation, especially in complex indoor environments, such as airport, exhibition halls, supermarkets, libraries, etc. The mobile terminal need to be identified with indoor location information. But because of the restriction of the positioning time, the positioning accuracy and complicated indoor environment, a relatively complete positioning technology is still unable to be good used. A number of solutions of the indoor positioning technology was proposed by Experts.


1. Indoor GPS technology
GPS, Global Positioning System, currently it is the most widely used positioning technology. When the GPS receiver works in the room, due to the influence of the building, the signal is greatly attenuated, then the positioning accuracy is very low. It is impossible to achieve the same result as the outdoor, extracting the navigation data and time information from the satellite broadcasting directly. In order to obtain a higher signal sensitivity, the residence time of the delay on each code needs to be extended.  
A-GPS (Assisted GPS) technology offers the possibility to solve this problem. A-GPS is the convergence technology between GPS technology and  the wireless cellular technology. The mobile terminal has not to download and decode the navigation data from the GPS satellites, receives directly the positioning information of the aid from the mobile network and has not to decode for the timing measurement.  
The advantage of the GPS satellite positioning is the wide and effective coverage and the free of the positioning signal and navigation signal. The disadvantage of the GPS is the weak signal by the reaching the ground and the high cost of the terminal.  

2. Infrared positioning technology  
The principle of infrared positioning technology, the infrared of identification sends the infrared radiation, positioning depends on the optical sensor, which receives the infrared radiation. While infrared has a relatively high positioning accuracy, but the light can not pass through the obstacle, so that the infrared is only the sight propagation. The straight sight and the short transmission distance are the two major disadvantages of infrared positioning, it makes the poor effect of the positioning.  

3. Ultrasonic positioning technology
