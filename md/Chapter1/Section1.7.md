#### OSI and TCP/IP

加人对比图分析  

OSI  

**OSI**, _Open System Interconnect_, is a reference model, which is developed by ISO and CCITT, providing the framework of a functional structure for the telecommunication or computing systems. It is from low to high : Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer and Application Layer.  

TCP/IP  

TCP / IP is a set of communication protocols, using to implement a network interconnection. It is the kernel for Internet network architecture. The reference model is divided into four levels, they are: Host-to-Network Layer, Internet Layer, Transport layer and the Application layer.

Reference Model Comparison  

The common point:  
* OSI reference model and TCP / IP reference models use the structure of hierarchy.  
* Both of them all provide connection-oriented service and connectionless service.  

The different point:
* OSI use seven-layer model, but TCP / IP is a four-layer structure.  
* Host-to-Network Layer is actually no real definition in TCP / IP reference model , has just some conceptual descriptions. But OSI reference model is not only divided the two layer(Physical Layer and Data Link Layer), but also are very detailed in the function of each layer.
* OSI model is designed before any protocols were developed, so it has universality. TCP / IP model has first the set of protocols, after that it built the model, so it does not apply to non-TCP / IP networks.  
* The concept of OSI reference model is the clear structure, but is too complex. TCP / IP reference model is not clear on the services, interfaces and the difference of protocols.
