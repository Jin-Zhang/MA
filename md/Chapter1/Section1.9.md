#### Switch

Switch, provides the exclusive path of the electrical signal, which connects to the switch, for any two nodes in network. The most common is the Ethernet switch.  

The switch works in the second layer (Data Link Layer) of the OSI reference model. The CPU of switch forms a MAC table  through the MAC address and the corresponding port, when each port on the switch is successfully connected. In the communication, it sends to the packet for the MAC address only by its corresponding port, instead of all ports.  

The switch makes the data transmission between the multiple ports at the same time. Each port can be regarded as a separate physical network segment, the network devices, which connect to the switch, use the the bandwidth alone, without the other devices to share.
